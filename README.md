Amazon Clone is a fully responsive e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. It replicates key functionalities of Amazon, including a home page that dynamically displays products from a database, a shopping page where users can browse and add products to their cart, and a cart page designed to match Amazonâ€™s style. The project also includes a user authentication system with secure login and registration, and MySQL database integration for storing products and user information. This project demonstrates my skills in frontend and backend web development, database management, and UI/UX design. Future enhancements may include product filtering, payment integration, and an improved search feature. ðŸš€
