# AmazonClone
This is a simple front-end clone of the Amazon e-commerce website, built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates basic e-commerce features such as product listings, a search bar for filtering products, and an interactive shopping cart. While there is no back-end or database, the website allows users to add and remove items from the cart using JavaScript. The design is fully responsive, ensuring the site looks great on both desktop and mobile devices. The project showcases how to structure an e-commerce site and provides an interactive experience using only front-end technologies.
