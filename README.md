Amazon Clone is a fully responsive e-commerce website built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP. It replicates key functionalities of Amazon, including a home page that dynamically displays products , a shopping page where users can browse and add products to their cart, and a cart page designed to match Amazonâ€™s style. The project also includes a user authentication system with secure login and registration. This project demonstrates my skills in frontend and backend web development, database management. Future enhancements may include product filtering, payment integration, and an improved search feature. ðŸš€
